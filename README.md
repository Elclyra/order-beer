# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Task description

Create a simple React web application which allows you to order beers.

Upon page load, the application initially loads beer selection data from https://random-data-api.com/api/beer/random_beer?size=20

Based on the available data it must be possible to create an order. Order consists of different beer groups. Beer groups are determined after field "style". For example all beers which have "style": "India Pale Ale" belong to a single group.

It must be possible to add and remove groups from your order. 

When adding beers to a group it must be possible to search from available beers using autocomplete. Search can be done after the field "brand" and "name". It must also be possible to remove added beers from a group.

For every group there are buttons + and - which automatically will add or remove available beers to/from the underlying group ordered by field "alcohol" starting from lowest value. If the user is happy with their order it must be possible to save or finalize the order. Order is considered open if not finalized. Finalized order can not be modified anymore. Open order can be modified at any time and can be stored in a local storage. There can be only 1 open order at the time. When order is finalized it must be visible under order history and order contents should be shown along with it. There can be multiple finalized orders.

It must be possible to refresh the beer selection at any point of time. When full page reload happens then previously loaded beer selection(s) can be considered as not usable anymore, however, added open order items are still valid.
